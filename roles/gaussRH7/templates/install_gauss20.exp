# This Expect script was generated by autoexpect on Mon Aug 31 23:46:49 2020
# Expect and autoexpect were both written by Don Libes, NIST.
#
# Note that autoexpect does not guarantee a working script.  It
# necessarily has to guess about certain things.  Two reasons a script
# might fail are:
#
# 1) timing - A surprising number of programs (rn, ksh, zsh, telnet,
# etc.) and devices discard or ignore keystrokes that arrive "too
# quickly" after prompts.  If you find your new script hanging up at
# one spot, try adding a short sleep just before the previous send.
# Setting "force_conservative" to 1 (see below) makes Expect do this
# automatically - pausing briefly before sending each character.  This
# pacifies every program I know of.  The -c flag makes the script do
# this in the first place.  The -C flag allows you to define a
# character to toggle this mode off and on.

set force_conservative 0  ;# set to 1 to force conservative mode even if
			  ;# script wasn't run conservatively originally
if {$force_conservative} {
	set send_slow {1 .1}
	proc send {ignore arg} {
		sleep .1
		exp_send -s -- $arg
	}
}

#
# 2) differing output - Some programs produce different output each time
# they run.  The "date" command is an obvious example.  Another is
# ftp, if it produces throughput statistics at the end of a file
# transfer.  If this causes a problem, delete these patterns or replace
# them with wildcards.  An alternative is to use the -p flag (for
# "prompt") which makes Expect only look for the last line of output
# (i.e., the prompt).  The -P flag allows you to define a character to
# toggle this mode off and on.
#
# Read the man page for more info.

Licensee's Program; and  \r
\r
         2)  Use. \r
\r
              A.  The GEPE or GEP may be licensed for Single \r
User OR Floating Network License Use.  \r
\r
              B..  The Java API is included as part of the GE \r

\r
     c.  GAUSS Run-Time Engine (GRTE).\r
\r
          1)  General.  The GRTE allows Licensee's Programs,\r

the End User owning or having access to a registered or\r

In the event, a non-Academic institution (e.g., corporation, \r

an Academic institution to do work on its behalf and the\r
resulting work requires the GRTE, then the applicable\r

Copy of the GEP Software Product.  Licensee of a Software\r
Product that includes the GRTE intends to allow Licensee's\r
End Users to access Licensee's Program which require the GEP\r
to execute.  By providing the GRTE to Licensee's End Users,\r
the Licensee's End Users are not required to Purchase their\r

GEPE utilize another Licensee's GEP to compile Licensee's\r
